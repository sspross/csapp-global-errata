# csapp-global-errata

This is an unofficial collection of errata for the global edition of _Computer System: A Programmer's Perspective_ (Third Edition). Most of the mistakes of the US version have been listed and corrected on the [authors' website](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/errata.html), and there is also [a list for Chinese version](http://www.yiligong.org/csapp3e/).

Unfortunately, according to the author's website,
> the publisher arranged for the generation of a different set of practice and homework problems in the global edition. The person doing this didn't do a very good job, and so these problems and their solutions have many errors. We have not created an errata for this edition. 
Thus, many mistakes of the global edition have not been corrected. This repository is a collection of those mistakes haven't been corrected in the authors' website.


## Preface

Global edition of this book is really buggy. Though most of its bugs can be easily figured
out when reading carefully, I am still surprised how can such a famous
book have so many errors.

I start to record mistakes from the middle of chapter 3

My book have around 36 pages offset from the US edition.
